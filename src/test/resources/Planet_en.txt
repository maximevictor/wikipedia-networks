The term ''planet'' is ancient, with ties to history, [[astrology]], science, [[mythology]], and religion. Several planets in the [[Solar System]] can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of [[deity|deities]]. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) officially adopted a resolution [[IAU definition of planet|defining planets]] within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of [[Planemo|planetary mass]] based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain "planets" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and [[Pluto]] (the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.

The planets were thought by [[Ptolemy]] to orbit [[Earth]] in [[deferent and epicycle]] motions. Although the idea that the [[Heliocentrism|planets orbited the Sun]] had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first [[telescope|telescopic]] [[Observational astronomy|astronomical observations]], performed by [[Galileo Galilei]]. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] found the planets' orbits were not circular but [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical]]. As observational tools improved, [[astronomer]]s saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as [[ice cap]]s and seasons. Since the dawn of the [[Space Age]], close observation by [[space probe]]s has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as [[Volcano|volcanism]], [[hurricane]]s, [[tectonics]], and even [[hydrology]].

Planets are generally divided into two main types: large low-density [[giant planet]]s, and smaller rocky [[terrestrial planet|terrestrials]]. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the [[Sun]], they are the four terrestrials, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], Earth, and [[Mars]], then the four giant planets, [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]]. Six of the planets are orbited by one or more [[natural satellite]]s.

Several thousands of planets around other stars ("[[#Exoplanets|extrasolar planet]]s" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the [[Milky Way]].

The idea of planets has evolved over its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age. The concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.

The five [[classical planet]]s, being visible to the naked eye, have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on [[mythology]], [[religious cosmology]], and ancient [[astronomy]]. In ancient times, astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky, as opposed to the "[[fixed stars]]", which maintained a constant relative position in the sky.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient Greek Astronomy and Cosmology|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/articles-and-essays/modeling-the-cosmos/ancient-greek-astronomy-and-cosmology|accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref> Ancient Greeks called these lights {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλάνης|πλάνητες]] [[wikt:ἀστήρ|ἀστέρες]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētes asteres''}}, "wandering stars") or simply {{lang|grc|[[wikt:πλανήτης#Ancient Greek|πλανῆται]]}} ({{Transl|grc|''planētai''}}, "wanderers"),<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dplanh%2Fths πλανήτης], H.

The ancient Greeks initially did not attach as much significance to the planets as the Babylonians. The [[Pythagoreans]], in the 6th and 5th centuries BC appear to have developed their own independent planetary theory, which consisted of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and planets revolving around a "Central Fire" at the center of the Universe. [[Pythagoras]] or [[Parmenides]] is said to have been the first to identify the evening star ([[Hesperos]]) and morning star ([[Phosphoros]]) as one and the same ([[Aphrodite]], Greek corresponding to Latin [[Venus]]).<ref name="burnet">{{cite book | first=John |last=Burnet |title= Greek philosophy: Thales to Plato |date=1950 |publisher=Macmillan and Co. |pages=7–11 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7yUAmmqHHEgC&pg=PR4 |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=978-1-4067-6601-1}}</ref> In the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] proposed a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] system, according to which Earth and the planets revolved around the Sun. The geocentric system remained dominant until the [[Scientific Revolution]].

By the 1st century BC, during the [[Hellenistic period]], the Greeks had begun to develop their own mathematical schemes for predicting the positions of the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the ''[[Almagest]]'' written by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries.<ref name="practice" /><ref name="almagest" /> To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be [[Geocentric model|circling Earth]] according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy.

=== India ===
{{Main article|Indian astronomy|Hindu cosmology}}

In 499 CE, the Indian astronomer [[Aryabhata]] propounded a planetary model that explicitly incorporated [[Earth's rotation]] about its axis, which he explains as the cause of what appears to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are [[Ellipse|elliptical]].<ref>J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Aryabhata_I.html Aryabhata the Elder], [[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]''</ref>
Aryabhata's followers were particularly strong in [[South India]], where his principles of the diurnal rotation of Earth, among others, were followed and a number of secondary works were based on them.<ref>[[K. V. Sarma|Sarma, K. V.]] (1997) "Astronomy in India" in [[Helaine Selin|Selin, Helaine]] (editor) ''Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|0-7923-4066-3}}, p. 116</ref>

In 1500, [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] of the [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]], in his ''[[Tantrasangraha]]'', revised Aryabhata's model.<ref name="MOPM">{{cite journal |title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers |last=Ramasubramanian |first=K. |journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India |volume=26 |pages=11–31 [23–4] |date=1998 |bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R}}</ref> In his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', he developed a planetary model where Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to the [[Tychonic system]] later proposed by [[Tycho Brahe]] in the late 16th century.

With the advent of the [[Scientific Revolution]], use of the term "planet" changed from something that moved across the sky (in relation to the [[Fixed stars|star field]]); to a body that orbited Earth (or that was believed to do so at the time); and by the 18th<!--in the 16th & 17th c. there were many other planets--> century to something that directly orbited the Sun when the [[heliocentric model]] of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] gained sway.

Thus, Earth became included in the list of planets,<ref name="galileo_project" /> whereas the Sun and Moon were excluded. At first, when the first satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were discovered in the 17th century, the terms "planet" and "satellite" were used interchangeably – although the latter would gradually become more prevalent in the following century.<ref>See primary citations in [[Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons#References|Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons]]</ref> Until the mid-19th century, the number of "planets" rose rapidly because any newly discovered object directly orbiting the Sun was listed as a planet by the scientific community.

In the 19th century astronomers began to realize that recently discovered bodies that had been classified as planets for almost half a century (such as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]]) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the [[asteroid belt]]), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as "[[asteroid]]s". In the absence of any formal definition, a "planet" came to be understood as any "large" body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.<ref>{{cite web | last =Hilton |first =James L. |date = 2001-09-17 |url =http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |title =When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets? |publisher =U.S. Naval Observatory |accessdate = 2007-04-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070921162818/http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php |archivedate = 2007-09-21}}</ref>

In 1992, astronomers [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] announced the discovery of planets around a [[pulsar]], [[PSR B1257+12]].<ref name="Wolszczan" /> This discovery is generally considered to be the first definitive detection of a planetary system around another star. Then, on October 6, 1995, [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[Geneva Observatory]] announced the first definitive detection of an exoplanet orbiting an ordinary [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star ([[51 Pegasi]]).<ref name="Mayor">{{cite journal | last1=Mayor |first1=Michel |author2=Queloz, Didier | title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star | journal=Nature | date=1995 | volume=378 | issue=6356 | pages=355–359 | doi= 10.1038/378355a0 | bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M}}</ref>

The discovery of extrasolar planets led to another ambiguity in defining a planet: the point at which a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as [[brown dwarf]]s. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse [[deuterium]], a heavier isotope of [[hydrogen]]. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Basri |first=Gibor |title= Observations of Brown Dwarfs |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |date=2000 |volume=38 | issue=1 |pages=485–519 |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.38.1.485 |bibcode=2000ARA&A..38..485B}}</ref>

=== 21st century ===

With the discovery during the latter half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a [[asteroid belt|belt]], or if it was large enough to generate energy by the [[thermonuclear fusion]] of [[deuterium]].

A growing number of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects approaching its size had been found in the same region of the Solar System (the [[Kuiper belt]]) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.

Some of them, such as [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], were heralded in the popular press as the [[tenth planet]], failing to receive widespread scientific recognition. The announcement of Eris in 2005, an object then thought of as 27% more massive than Pluto, created the necessity and public desire for an official definition of a planet.

Acknowledging the problem, the IAU set about creating the [[IAU definition of planet|definition of planet]], and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had [[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared their orbit]] (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune), and a new class of [[dwarf planet]]s was created, initially containing three objects ([[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[Pluto]] and Eris).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Green |first=D.

==== Extrasolar planets ====

There is no official definition of [[extrasolar planet]]s.  In 2003, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) Working Group on Extrasolar Planets issued a position statement, but this position statement was never proposed as an official IAU resolution and was never voted on by IAU members.  The positions statement incorporates the following guidelines, mostly focused upon the boundary between planets and brown dwarfs:<ref name="WSGESP" />
# Objects with [[true mass]]es below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium (currently calculated to be 13 times the mass of Jupiter for objects with the same [[natural abundance|isotopic abundance]] as the Sun<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Saumon |first1=D. |display-authors=4 |author2=Hubbard, W. B. |author3=Burrows, A. |author4=Guillot, T. |author5=Lunine, J. I. |author6=Chabrier, G. |title=A Theory of Extrasolar Giant Planets |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=1996 |volume=460 |pages=993–1018 |bibcode=1996ApJ...460..993S |doi=10.1086/177027|arxiv = astro-ph/9510046 }}</ref>) that orbit stars or stellar remnants are "planets" (no matter how they formed). The minimum mass and size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.
# Substellar objects with true masses above the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are "[[brown dwarf]]s", no matter how they formed or where they are located.
# Free-floating objects in young [[star cluster]]s with masses below the limiting mass for thermonuclear fusion of deuterium are not "planets", but are "sub-brown dwarfs" (or whatever name is most appropriate).

This working definition has since been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in [[academic journal]]s.<ref>See for example the list of references for: {{cite web | author=Butler, R. P.  | display-authors=etal |date=2006 |url=http://exoplanets.org/ |title=Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets |publisher =University of California and the Carnegie Institution |accessdate = 2008-08-23}}</ref> Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It does not address the dispute over the lower mass limit,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/outerplanets-04b.html |title=Gravity Rules: The Nature and Meaning of Planethood |last=Stern |first=S. Alan |date=2004-03-22 |publisher=SpaceDaily |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> and so it steered clear of the controversy regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as [[2M1207b]].

One definition of a [[sub-brown dwarf]] is a planet-mass object that formed through [[cloud collapse]] rather than [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet as part of its division in classification.<ref name="Cha110913">{{cite web

 |accessdate=2006-03-26}}</ref> One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by [[accretion disc|accretion]] around a star may get ejected from the system to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.

The 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff represents an average mass rather than a precise threshold value. Large objects will fuse most of their deuterium and smaller ones will fuse only a little, and the 13 {{Jupiter mass}} value is somewhere in between. In fact, calculations show that an object fuses 50% of its initial deuterium content when the total mass ranges between 12 and 14 {{Jupiter mass}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bodenheimer|first1=Peter|last2=D'Angelo|first2=Gennaro|last3=Lissauer|first3=Jack J.|last4=Fortney|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Saumon|first5=Didier|title=Deuterium Burning in Massive Giant Planets and Low-mass Brown Dwarfs Formed by Core-nucleated Accretion|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=20 June 2013|volume=770|issue=2|pages=120|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/770/2/120|arxiv = 1305.0980 |bibcode = 2013ApJ...770..120B }}</ref> The amount of deuterium fused depends not only on mass but also on the composition of the object, on the amount of [[helium]] and [[deuterium]] present.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1008.5150 |author1=Spiegel |author2=Adam Burrows |author3=Milsom |title=The Deuterium-Burning Mass Limit for Brown Dwarfs and Giant Planets |class=astro-ph.EP |date=2010}}</ref> The [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, "The fact that there is no special feature around 13 {{Jupiter mass}} in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schneider |first1=J. |display-authors=4 |last2=Dedieu |first2=C. |last3=Le Sidaner |first3=P. |last4=Savalle |first4=R. |last5=Zolotukhin |first5=I. |title=Defining and cataloging exoplanets: The exoplanet.eu database|date=2011|volume=532|issue=79|journal=[[Astronomy & Astrophysics]] |arxiv=1106.0586|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201116713|pages=A79|bibcode=2011A&A...532A..79S}}</ref> The [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: "The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity."<ref name=eod>{{cite arXiv|eprint=1012.5676v1|last1=Wright |first1=J.

==== 2006 IAU definition of planet ====
{{Main article|IAU definition of planet}}
[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|350px|right|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.]]

The matter of the lower limit was addressed during the 2006 meeting of the [[International Astronomical Union#The XXVIth General Assembly and the definition of a planet|IAU's General Assembly]]. After much debate and one failed proposal, 232 members of the 10,000 member assembly, who nevertheless constituted a large majority of those remaining at the meeting, voted to pass a resolution. The 2006 resolution defines planets within the Solar System as follows:<ref name="IAU"/>

{{quotation|A "planet" [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.<br />
[1] The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
}}

Under this definition, the Solar System is considered to have eight planets. Bodies that fulfill the first two conditions but not the third (such as Ceres, Pluto, and Eris) are classified as [[dwarf planet]]s, provided they are not also [[natural satellite]]s of other planets. Originally an IAU committee had proposed a definition that would have included a much larger number of planets as it did not include (c) as a criterion.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4795755.stm |title=Planets plan boosts tally 12 |publisher=BBC |date=2006-08-16 |accessdate=2008-08-23 |first=Paul |last=Rincon}}</ref> After much discussion, it was decided via a vote that those bodies should instead be classified as dwarf planets.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/5282440.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Pluto loses status as a planet |date=2006-08-24 |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>

This definition is based in theories of planetary formation, in which planetary embryos initially clear their orbital neighborhood of other smaller objects. As described by astronomer [[Steven Soter]]:<ref>{{cite journal | last = Soter |first = Steven |title = What is a Planet |journal = Astronomical Journal |volume = 132 |issue = 6 |pages = 2513–19 |date = 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 |bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S}}</ref>

:"The end product of secondary disk accretion is a small number of relatively large bodies (planets) in either non-intersecting or resonant orbits, which prevent collisions between them. Minor planets and comets, including KBOs [Kuiper belt objects], differ from planets in that they can collide with each other and with planets."

The 2006 IAU definition presents some challenges for exoplanets because the language is specific to the Solar System and because the criteria of roundness and orbital zone clearance are not presently observable.  Astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star, based on the mass of the planet, its semimajor axis, and the mass of its host star.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151110134519.htm|title=Simpler way to define what makes a planet|date=2015-11-10|publisher=Science Daily}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Why we need a new definition of the word 'planet'|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-new-planet-definition-margot-20151113-htmlstory.html|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>  This formula produces a value <big>π</big> that is greater than 1 for planets.

== Mythology and naming ==
{{see also|Weekday names|Naked-eye planet}}
[[File:Olympians.jpg|thumb|upright|The Greek gods of [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]], after whom the [[Solar System]]'s  Roman names of the planets are derived]]

The names for the planets in the Western world are derived from the naming practices of the Romans, which ultimately derive from those of the Greeks and the Babylonians. In [[ancient Greece]], the two great luminaries the Sun and the Moon were called ''[[Helios]]'' and ''[[Selene]]''; the farthest planet (Saturn) was called ''Phainon'', the shiner; followed by ''Phaethon'' (Jupiter), "bright"; the red planet (Mars) was known as ''Pyroeis'', the "fiery"; the brightest (Venus) was known as ''Phosphoros'', the light bringer; and the fleeting final planet (Mercury) was called ''Stilbon'', the gleamer. The Greeks also made each planet sacred to one among their pantheon of gods, the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]]: Helios and Selene were the names of both planets and gods; Phainon was sacred to [[Cronus]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who fathered the Olympians; Phaethon was sacred to [[Zeus]], Cronus's son who deposed him as king; Pyroeis was given to [[Ares]], son of Zeus and god of war; Phosphoros was ruled by [[Aphrodite]], the goddess of love; and [[Hermes]], messenger of the gods and god of learning and wit, ruled over Stilbon.<ref name="practice">{{cite book |title=The History and Practice of Ancient Astronomy |first=James |last=Evans |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1998 |pages=296–7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&pg=PA17
|accessdate=2008-02-04 |isbn=978-0-19-509539-5}}</ref>

The Greek practice of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets was almost certainly borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named [[Hesperus#Variant names|Phosphoros]] after their goddess of love, ''[[Ishtar]]''; Pyroeis after their god of war, ''[[Nergal]]'', Stilbon after their god of wisdom [[Nabu]], and Phaethon after their chief god, ''[[Marduk]]''.<ref name="nergal">{{cite web |first=Kelley L. |last=Ross |date=2005 |title=The Days of the Week |url=http://www.friesian.com/week.htm |publisher=The Friesian School |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for them to have arisen separately.<ref name="practice" /> The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.<ref>{{cite book |title=Martian Metamorphoses: The Planet Mars in Ancient Myth and Tradition |first=Ev |last=Cochrane |date=1997 |publisher=Aeon Press |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jz3eqRGuM0wC&pg=PP9&dq=ares+nergal+planet+pestilence |accessdate=2008-02-07 |isbn=0-9656229-0-8}}</ref>

Today, most people in the western world know the planets by names derived from the Olympian pantheon of gods. Although modern Greeks still use their ancient names for the planets, other European languages, because of the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and, later, the [[Catholic Church]], use the Roman (Latin) names rather than the Greek ones. The Romans, who, like the Greeks, were [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-Europeans]], shared with them a [[Roman mythology|common pantheon]] under different names but lacked the rich narrative traditions that Greek poetic culture had given [[Greek mythology|their gods]]. During the later period of the [[Roman Republic]], Roman writers borrowed much of the Greek narratives and applied them to their own pantheon, to the point where they became virtually indistinguishable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Greek Mythography in the Roman World |first=Alan |last=Cameron |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-517121-7}}</ref> When the Romans studied Greek astronomy, they gave the planets their own gods' names: ''[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]]'' (for Hermes), ''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'' (Aphrodite), ''[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' (Ares), ''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]'' (Zeus) and ''[[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]]'' (Cronus). When subsequent planets were discovered in the 18th and 19th centuries, the naming practice was retained with ''[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]]'' ([[Poseidon]]). Uranus is unique in that it is named for a [[Uranus (mythology)|Greek deity]] rather than his [[Caelus|Roman counterpart]].

Some [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], following a belief possibly originating in [[Mesopotamia]] but developed in [[Hellenistic Egypt]],<!--<ref>{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Arnett |date=2006 |title=Appendix 5: Planetary Linguistics |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/days.html |publisher=www.nineplanets.org |accessdate=2008-02-02}}{{Verify credibility|date=February 2008}}</ref>--> believed that the seven gods after whom the planets were named took hourly shifts in looking after affairs on Earth. The order of shifts went Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon (from the farthest to the closest planet).<ref name="zerubavel">{{cite book | first=Eviatar |last=Zerubavel |date=1989 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-98165-7 |title= The Seven Day Circle: The History and Meaning of the Week |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aGahKeojIUoC&pg=PA14 |accessdate=2008-02-07}}</ref> Therefore, the first day was started by Saturn (1st hour), second day by Sun (25th hour), followed by Moon (49th hour), Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus.

Earth is the only planet whose name in English is not derived from Greco-Roman mythology. Because it was only generally accepted as a planet in the 17th century,<ref name="galileo_project">{{cite web | last=Van Helden |first=Al |date=1995 |url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/copernican_system.html |title=Copernican System |publisher=The Galileo Project |accessdate=2008-01-28}}</ref> there is no tradition of naming it after a god. (The same is true, in English at least, of the Sun and the Moon, though they are no longer generally considered planets.) The name originates from the 8th century [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''erda'', which means ground or soil and was first used in writing as the name of the sphere of Earth perhaps around 1300.<ref>{{cite web | publisher= Oxford English Dictionary |url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50071589?query_type=word&queryword=earth&first=1&max_to_show=10&sort_type=alpha&result_place=1&search_id=7aas-q054tm-4631&hilite=50071589 | title = earth, n |accessdate = 2008-02-06 |date = 1989}}</ref><ref name="etymearth">{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas |date = September 2001 |url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=earth |title = Earth |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate = 2008-08-23}}</ref> As with its equivalents in the other [[Germanic languages]], it derives ultimately from the [[Proto-Germanic]] word ''ertho'', "ground",<ref name="etymearth"/> as can be seen in the English ''earth'', the German ''Erde'', the Dutch ''aarde'', and the Scandinavian ''jord''. Many of the [[Romance languages]] retain the old Roman word ''[[Terra (mythology)|terra]]'' (or some variation of it) that was used with the meaning of "dry land" as opposed to "sea".<ref>{{cite web |last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=September 2001 |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=terrain |title=Etymology of "terrain" |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2008-01-30}}</ref> The non-Romance languages use their own native words. The Greeks retain their original name, ''[[Gaia (mythology)|Γή]]'' ''(Ge)''.

Non-European cultures use other planetary-naming systems. [[India]] uses a system based on the [[Navagraha]], which incorporates the seven traditional planets ([[Surya]] for the Sun, [[Chandra]] for the Moon, and [[Budha]], [[Shukra]], [[Mangala]], [[Bṛhaspati|{{IAST|Bṛhaspati}}]] and [[Shani]] for Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and the ascending and descending [[lunar node]]s [[Rahu]] and [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]]. China and the countries of eastern Asia historically subject to [[Chinese cultural sphere|Chinese cultural influence]] (such as Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]) use a naming system based on the [[Wu Xing|five Chinese elements]]: [[Water (classical element)|water]] (Mercury), [[Metal (classical element)|metal]] (Venus), [[Fire (classical element)|fire]] (Mars), [[Wood (classical element)|wood]] (Jupiter) and [[Earth (classical element)|earth]] (Saturn).<ref name="weekdays" /> In traditional [[Hebrew astronomy]], the seven traditional planets have (for the most part) descriptive names - the Sun is חמה ''Ḥammah'' or "the hot one," the Moon is לבנה ''Levanah'' or "the white one," Venus is כוכב נוגה ''Kokhav Nogah'' or "the bright planet," Mercury is כוכב ''Kokhav'' or "the planet" (given its lack of distinguishing features), Mars is מאדים ''Ma'adim'' or "the red one," and Saturn is שבתאי ''Shabbatai'' or "the resting one" (in reference to its slow movement compared to the other visible planets).<ref name=Hebrew>{{cite journal|last1=Stieglitz|first1=Robert|title=The Hebrew Names of the Seven Planets|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=Apr 1981|volume=40|issue=2|pages=135–137|doi=10.1086/372867|jstor=545038}}</ref> The odd one out is Jupiter, called צדק ''Tzedeq'' or "justice."

== Formation ==
{{Main article|Nebular hypothesis}}
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|left|thumb|300px|An artist's impression of protoplanetary disk]]
It is not known with certainty how planets are formed. The prevailing theory is that they are formed during the collapse of a [[nebula]] into a thin disk of gas and dust. A [[protostar]] forms at the core, surrounded by a rotating [[protoplanetary disk]]. Through [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] (a process of sticky collision) dust particles in the disk steadily accumulate mass to form ever-larger bodies. Local concentrations of mass known as [[planetesimal]]s form, and these accelerate the accretion process by drawing in additional material by their gravitational attraction. These concentrations become ever denser until they collapse inward under gravity to form [[protoplanet]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | first=G.

There are eight planets in the [[Solar System]], which are in increasing distance from the [[Sun]]:

# [[File:Uranus symbol.svg|14px|♅]] '''[[Uranus]]'''
# [[File:Neptune symbol.svg|14px|♆]] '''[[Neptune]]'''

Jupiter is the largest, at 318 Earth masses, whereas Mercury is the smallest, at 0.055 Earth masses.

The planets of the Solar System can be divided into categories based on their composition:
* '''[[Terrestrial planet|Terrestrials]]''': Planets that are similar to Earth, with bodies largely composed of [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. At 0.055 Earth masses, Mercury is the smallest terrestrial planet (and smallest planet) in the Solar System. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet.
* '''[[Giant planet]]s''' (Jovians): Massive planets significantly more massive than the terrestrials: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
** '''[[Gas giant]]s''', Jupiter and Saturn, are giant planets primarily composed of hydrogen and helium and are the most massive planets in the Solar System. Jupiter, at 318 Earth masses, is the largest planet in the Solar System, and Saturn is one third as massive, at 95 Earth masses.
** '''[[Ice giant]]s''', Uranus and Neptune, are primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials such as water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).

The first confirmed discovery of an extrasolar planet orbiting an ordinary main-sequence star occurred on 6 October 1995, when [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] of the [[University of Geneva]] announced the detection of an exoplanet around [[51 Pegasi]]. From then until the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler mission]] most known extrasolar planets were gas giants comparable in mass to Jupiter or larger as they were more easily detected. The catalog of Kepler candidate planets consists mostly of planets the size of Neptune and smaller, down to smaller than Mercury.

There are types of planets that do not exist in the Solar System: [[super-Earth]]s and [[mini-Neptune]]s, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of volatiles and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1311.0329 |last1=Lopez |first1=E.

There are exoplanets that are much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, and there are also exoplanets that are much farther from their star. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 [[astronomical unit|AU]], takes 88-days for an orbit, but the shortest known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. [[Kepler-70b]]. The [[Kepler-11]] system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. [[Neptune]] is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years to orbit, but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of [[astronomical unit|AU]] from their star and take more than a thousand years to orbit, e.g. [[1RXS1609 b]].

The next few [[space telescope]]s to study exoplanets are expected to be [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]] launched in December 2013, [[CHEOPS (spacecraft)|CHEOPS]] in 2017, [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] in 2017, and the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] in 2018.

These include [[dwarf planet]]s, which are rounded by their own gravity but not massive enough to [[Clearing the neighbourhood|clear their own orbit]], the larger [[natural satellite|moons]], and free-floating planemos, which may have been ejected from a system ([[rogue planet]]s) or formed through cloud-collapse rather than accretion (sometimes called [[sub-brown dwarf]]s).

=== Sub-brown dwarfs ===
{{Main article|Sub-brown dwarf}}
Stars form via the gravitational collapse of gas clouds, but smaller objects can also form via cloud-collapse. Planetary-mass objects formed this way are sometimes called sub-brown dwarfs. Sub-brown dwarfs may be free-floating such as [[Cha 110913-773444]]<ref name="Luhman" /> and [[OTS 44]],<ref name=joergens2013_AA558>{{cite journal|last1=Joergens|first1=V.|display-authors=4|last2=Bonnefoy|first2=M.|last3=Liu|first3=Y.|last4=Bayo|first4=A.|last5=Wolf|first5=S.|last6=Chauvin|first6=G.|last7=Rojo|first7=P.|title=OTS 44: Disk and accretion at the planetary border|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=558|number=7|date=2013|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201322432|bibcode=2013A&A...558L...7J|arxiv = 1310.1936|pages=L7}}</ref> or orbiting a larger object such as [[2MASS J04414489+2301513]].

Binary systems of sub-brown dwarfs are theoretically possible; [[Oph 162225-240515]] was initially thought to be a binary system of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Wide Brown Dwarf Binary Oph 1622–2405 and Discovery of A Wide, Low Mass Binary in Ophiuchus (Oph 1623–2402): A New Class of Young Evaporating Wide Binaries? |journal= Astrophysical Journal |author=Close, Laird M. |volume=660 | issue=2 |pages=1492–1506 |doi=10.1086/513417 |date=2007 |arxiv=astro-ph/0608574 |bibcode=2007ApJ...660.1492C | display-authors=4 | last2=Zuckerman | first2=B. | last3=Song | first3=Inseok | last4=Barman | first4=Travis | last5=Marois | first5=Christian | last6=Rice | first6=Emily L. | last7=Siegler | first7=Nick | last8=MacIntosh | first8=Bruce | last9=Becklin | first9=E.

=== Former stars ===
In close [[binary star]] systems one of the stars can lose mass to a heavier companion. [[Accretion-powered pulsars]] may drive mass loss. The shrinking star can then become a [[planetary-mass object]]. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the [[pulsar]] [[PSR J1719-1438]].<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=1108.5201 |bibcode=2011Sci...333.1717B |doi=10.1126/science.1208890 |title=Transformation of a Star into a Planet in a Millisecond Pulsar Binary |date=2011 |last1=Bailes |first1=M. |display-authors=4 |last2=Bates |first2=S.

=== Satellite planets and belt planets ===
Some large satellites are of similar size or larger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], e.g. Jupiter's [[Galilean moons]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. [[Alan Stern]] has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term ''satellite planet'' for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the [[asteroid belt]] and [[Kuiper belt]] should be considered planets according to Stern.<ref name="satelliteplanet">{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/should-large-moons-be-called-satellite-planets.html#post-a-comment |title=Should Large Moons Be Called 'Satellite Planets'? |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

=== Captured planets ===
[[Rogue planet|Free-floating planet]]s in [[open cluster|stellar clusters]] have similar velocities to the stars and so can be recaptured. They are typically captured into wide orbits between 100 and <!--abstract seems to have a typo 10^6: rest of paper uses 10^5-->10<sup>5</sup> AU<!--see preceding comment-->. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster volume, and for a given cluster size it increases with the host/primary mass. It is almost independent of the planetary mass. Single and multiple planets could be captured into arbitrary unaligned orbits, non-coplanar with each other or with the stellar host spin, or pre-existing planetary system.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2362 On the origin of planets at very wide orbits from the re-capture of free floating planets], Hagai B. Perets, M. B. N. Kouwenhoven, 2012</ref>

== Attributes ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Earth radius]] -->
Although each planet has unique physical characteristics, a number of broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of these characteristics, such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.

==== Orbit ====

According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential "[[rogue planet]]s" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, [[WASP-17b]], has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation.<ref>{{cite arXiv | author = D. R.

No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its [[periastron]] ([[perihelion]] in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its [[apastron]] ([[aphelion]]). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.<ref>{{cite book | author=Dvorak, R. | author2=Kurths, J. | author3=Freistetter, F. |date=2005 |title=Chaos And Stability in Planetary Systems |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-28208-4}}</ref>

Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements:
* The ''[[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]]'' of an orbit describes how elongated a planet's orbit is. Planets with low eccentricities have more circular orbits, whereas planets with high eccentricities have more elliptical orbits. The planets in the Solar System have very low eccentricities, and thus nearly circular orbits.<ref name="young"/> Comets and Kuiper belt objects (as well as several extrasolar planets) have very high eccentricities, and thus exceedingly elliptical orbits.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Eccentricity evolution of giant planet orbits due to circumstellar disk torques |author=Moorhead, Althea V. |author2=Adams, Fred C. |journal=Icarus |date=2008 |volume=193 |issue=2 |pages=475–484 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2007.07.009 |arxiv=0708.0335 |bibcode=2008Icar..193..475M}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Planets – Kuiper Belt Objects |work=The Astrophysics Spectator |date=2004-12-15 | url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/KuiperBelt.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>
* [[File:Semimajoraxis.svg|thumb|Illustration of the semi-major axis]] The ''[[semi-major axis]]'' is the distance from a planet to the half-way point along the longest diameter of its elliptical orbit (see image). This distance is not the same as its apastron, because no planet's orbit has its star at its exact centre.<ref name="young" />
* The ''[[inclination]]'' of a planet tells how far above or below an established reference plane its orbit lies. In the Solar System, the reference plane is the plane of Earth's orbit, called the [[ecliptic]]. For extrasolar planets, the plane, known as the ''sky plane'' or ''plane of the sky'', is the plane perpendicular to the observer's line of sight from Earth.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~tatum/celmechs.html |title=Celestial Mechanics |date=2007 |chapter=17.

The [[argument of periapsis]] (or perihelion in the Solar System) is the angle between a planet's ascending node and its closest approach to its star.<ref name="young" />

==== Axial tilt ====
{{Main article|Axial tilt}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|Earth's [[axial tilt]] is about 23.4°. It oscillates between 22.1° and 24.5° on a 41,000-year cycle and is currently decreasing.]]

Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt; they lie at an angle to the [[reference plane|plane]] of their [[inclination|stars' equators]]. This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its [[solstice]]. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's axial tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices.<ref name="Weather">{{cite web | last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=2006-05-01 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> Among extrasolar planets, axial tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Obliquity Tides on Hot Jupiters |author=Winn, Joshua N. |author2=Holman, Matthew J. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2005 | doi=10.1086/432834 | volume=628 |issue=2 |pages=L159 |bibcode=2005ApJ...628L.159W|arxiv = astro-ph/0506468 }}</ref>

==== Rotation ====
The planets rotate around invisible axes through their centres. A planet's [[rotation period]] is known as a [[day|stellar day]]. Most of the planets in the Solar System rotate in the same direction as they orbit the Sun, which is counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Geographic poles|north pole]], the exceptions being Venus<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rotation of Venus: Period Estimated from Radar Measurements |author=Goldstein, R.

T.}}</ref> which rotate clockwise, though Uranus's extreme axial tilt means there are differing conventions on which of its poles is "north", and therefore whether it is rotating clockwise or anti-clockwise.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Outer Worlds; Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and Beyond |pages=195–206 |date=2006 |first=Michael P. |last=Borgia |publisher=Springer New York}}</ref> Regardless of which convention is used, Uranus has a [[retrograde rotation]] relative to its orbit.

The rotation of a planet can be induced by several factors during formation. A net [[angular momentum]] can be induced by the individual angular momentum contributions of accreted objects. The accretion of gas by the giant planets can also contribute to the angular momentum.

==== Orbital clearing ====
{{Main article|Clearing the neighbourhood}}
The defining dynamic characteristic of a planet is that it has ''cleared its neighborhood''. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the [[planetesimal]]s in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s official [[2006 definition of planet|definition of a planet]] in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as [[Pluto]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] and [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] from full-fledged planethood, making them instead [[dwarf planet]]s.<ref name="IAU" /> Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their [[circumstellar disc]]s.<ref>{{cite arXiv |title=The Total Number of Giant Planets in Debris Disks with Central Clearings |date=2007-07-12 |author=Faber, Peter |author2=Quillen, Alice C. |eprint=0706.1684 |class=astro-ph}}</ref>

=== Physical characteristics ===

==== Mass ====
{{Main article|Planetary mass}}
A planet's defining physical characteristic is that it is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the [[electromagnetic force]]s binding its physical structure, leading to a state of [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Dwarf Planets |url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dwarfplanets/ |authorlink=Michael E. Brown |last=Brown |first=Michael E. |work=California Institute of Technology |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-02-01}}</ref>

Mass is also the prime attribute by which planets are distinguished from [[star]]s. The upper mass limit for planethood is roughly 13 times Jupiter's mass for objects with solar-type [[isotopic abundance]], beyond which it achieves conditions suitable for [[nuclear fusion]]. Other than the Sun, no objects of such mass exist in the Solar System; but there are exoplanets of this size. The 13-Jupiter-mass limit is not universally agreed upon and the [[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]] includes objects up to 20 Jupiter masses,<ref>[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=exoplanet-catalogue How One Astronomer Became the Unofficial Exoplanet Record-Keeper], www.scientificamerican.com</ref> and the [[Exoplanet Data Explorer]] up to 24 Jupiter masses.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=1012.5676 |author1=Jason T Wright |author2=Onsi Fakhouri |author3=Marcy |author4=Eunkyu Han |author5=Ying Feng |author6=John Asher Johnson |author7=Howard |author8=Fischer |author9=Valenti |title=The Exoplanet Orbit Database |class=astro-ph.SR |date=2010|last10=Anderson |first10=Jay |last11=Piskunov |first11=Nikolai }}</ref>

The smallest known planet is [[PSR B1257+12A]], one of the first extrasolar planets discovered, which was found in 1992 in orbit around a [[pulsar]]. Its mass is roughly half that of the planet Mercury.<ref name="Encyclopaedia" /> The smallest known planet orbiting a main-sequence star other than the Sun is [[Kepler-37b]], with a mass (and radius) slightly higher than that of the [[Moon]].

==== Internal differentiation ====
{{Main article|Planetary differentiation}}
[[File:Jupiter interior.png|upright|thumb|Illustration of the interior of Jupiter, with a rocky core overlaid by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen]]

Every planet began its existence in an entirely fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a [[Planetary differentiation|differentiated]] interior consisting of a dense [[planetary core]] surrounded by a [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] that either is or was a [[fluid]]. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard [[Crust (geology)|crusts]],<ref name="terrestrial">{{cite web |title=Planetary Interiors |work=Department of Physics, University of Oregon |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec16.html |accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref> but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]], and mantles of [[silicate]]s. [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are believed to have cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of [[metallic hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Linda T. |last=Elkins-Tanton |date=2006 |title=Jupiter and Saturn |publisher=Chelsea House |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5196-8}}</ref> [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of [[water]], [[ammonia]], [[methane]] and other [[Volatiles|ices]].<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0032-0633(95)00061-5| last1 = Podolak| first1 = M.| last2 = Weizman| first2 = A.| last3 = Marley| first3 = M.| date=December 1995 | title = Comparative models of Uranus and Neptune| journal = Planetary and Space Science| volume = 43| issue = 12| pages = 1517–1522| pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1995P&SS...43.1517P| ref = {{sfnRef|Podolak Weizman et al.|1995}}}}</ref> The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a [[geodynamo]] that generates a [[magnetic field]].<ref name="terrestrial" />

All of the Solar System planets except [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]<ref>Hunten D. M., Shemansky D. E., Morgan T. H. (1988), ''The Mercury atmosphere'', In: Mercury (A89-43751 19–91).

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying [[insolation]] or internal energy, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s (on Mars), a greater-than-Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).<ref name="Weather" /> At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.<ref name="knutson">{{cite journal | last1=Knutson |first1=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b |journal=Nature |date=2007 |volume=447 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |laysummary=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2007/pr200713.html |laysource=Center for Astrophysics press release |laydate=2007-05-09 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K | pages=183–6|arxiv = 0705.0993}}</ref>

Hot Jupiters, due to their extreme proximities to their host stars, have been shown to be losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets.<ref>{{cite press release |first1=Donna |last1=Weaver |first2=Ray |last2=Villard |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/full/ |title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere |publisher=Space Telescope Science Institute |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | journal=Nature |last1=Ballester |first1=Gilda E. |author2=Sing, David K. |author3=Herbert, Floyd |title=The signature of hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b |volume=445 |date=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05525 |pmid=17268463 |issue=7127 |bibcode=2007Natur.445..511B | pages=511–4}}</ref> These planets may have vast differences in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds,<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Harrington |first1=Jason |author2=Hansen, Brad M. |author3=Luszcz, Statia H. |author4=Seager, Sara |title=The phase-dependent infrared brightness of the extrasolar planet Andromeda b |journal=Science |volume=314 |date=2006 |doi=10.1126/science.1133904 |laysummary=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/spitzer-20061012.html |laysource=NASA press release |laydate=2006-10-12 |pmid=17038587 |issue=5799 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..623H | pages=623–6|arxiv = astro-ph/0610491 }}</ref> although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.<ref name="knutson" />

==== Magnetosphere ====
{{Main article|Magnetosphere}}
[[File:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|[[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's magnetosphere]] (diagram)]]

One important characteristic of the planets is their intrinsic [[magnetic moment]]s, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that the planet is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of [[electrical conductivity|electrically conducting]] material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of the planet and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than the planet itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the [[ionosphere]] with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect the planet.<ref name="Kivelson2007" />

Of the eight planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a magnetic field.<ref name="Kivelson2007" /> In addition, the moon of Jupiter [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] also has one. Of the magnetized planets the magnetic field of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the [[solar wind]]. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are strongly tilted relative the rotational [[Axis of rotation|axis]] and displaced from the centre of the planet.<ref name="Kivelson2007">{{cite book | last1=Kivelson |first1=Margaret Galland |author2=Bagenal, Fran |chapter=Planetary Magnetospheres |title=Encyclopedia of the Solar System |date=2007 |publisher=Academic Press |editor= Lucyann Mcfadden |editor2= Paul Weissman |editor3= Torrence Johnson |isbn=978-0-12-088589-3 |page=519}}</ref>

In 2004, a team of astronomers in Hawaii observed an extrasolar planet around the star [[HD 179949]], which appeared to be creating a sunspot on the surface of its parent star. The team hypothesized that the planet's magnetosphere was transferring energy onto the star's surface, increasing its already high 7,760&nbsp;°C temperature by an additional 400&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite web | title=Magnetic planet |first=Amanda | last=Gefter | work=Astronomy |date=2004-01-17 |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&id=2090 |accessdate=2008-01-29}}</ref>

=== Secondary characteristics ===
{{Main article|Natural satellite|Planetary ring}}
[[File:Voyager 2 - Saturn Rings - 3085 7800 2.png|thumb|upright|The [[rings of Saturn]]]]

Several planets or dwarf planets in the Solar System (such as Neptune and Pluto) have orbital periods that are in [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with each other or with smaller bodies (this is also common in satellite systems). All except Mercury and Venus have [[natural satellite]]s, often called "moons". Earth has one, Mars has two, and the giant planets have numerous moons in complex planetary-type systems. Many moons of the giant planets have features similar to those on the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets, and some have been studied as possible abodes of life (especially [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]).<ref name="Grasset2000">{{cite journal | last1=Grasset |first1=O. |author2=Sotin C. |author3=Deschamps F. |title = On the internal structure and dynamic of Titan |date = 2000 |journal = Planetary and Space Science |volume = 48 | issue= 7–8 | pages = 617–636 |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(00)00039-8 | bibcode=2000P&SS...48..617G}}</ref><ref name="Fortes2000">{{cite journal | journal = Icarus |volume= 146 |issue = 2 |pages = 444–452 |date= 2000 |doi = 10.1006/icar.2000.6400 |title = Exobiological implications of a possible ammonia-water ocean inside Titan |author = Fortes, A.

The four giant planets are also orbited by [[planetary ring]]s of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny '[[Rings of Saturn#Moonlets|moonlets]]' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although the origins of planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed to be the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's [[Roche limit]] and were torn apart by [[tidal force]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Molnar, L. A. | author2=Dunn, D.

No secondary characteristics have been observed around extrasolar planets. The [[sub-brown dwarf]] [[Cha 110913-773444]], which has been described as a [[rogue planet]], is believed to be orbited by a tiny [[protoplanetary disc]]<ref name="Luhman" /> and the sub-brown dwarf [[OTS 44]] was shown to be surrounded by a substantial protoplanetary disk of at least 10 Earth masses.<ref name=joergens2013_AA558 />
